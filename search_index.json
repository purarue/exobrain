matchedPatternAction is the same thing that sedgreplexyacc usesPatternAction is very good for small programs because the ifthenstructure is how we think when tacking small problemsFor actions build on something people already know awk has a Clikesyntax because lots of people knew CAutomate what you know people will often do with your tool That maymean adding flags for common use cases or fallback to defaultscoercetypesstrings into what you need depending on the contextLessons from other people using your languages   If you do anything useful people will abuse it       You will get nowhere trying to stop people from extending it so        the domain either should be well defined or you should be fine        with people doing what they want   Existence of a language encourages programs to generate it to    facilitate complicated or handle otherwise impossible cases       machine generated inputs stress differently than people do   Mistakes are inevitable and hard to change   creeping featureism from user pressure and other implementations    do you keep your codebase the same so people who know it still know    it or do you change core aspects because you had a better ideaCase Study AMPLAMPL is a DSL for describing optimization problems and then compilingdescriptions into solver problemsIt optimizing some problem given constraints and dataModelThe data is modeled with a data specification language which looks alot like sparse matricesData SpecificationThe last part of AMPL was how youd run it the command languageiethe CLI interfaceCommandWhether or not a DSL needs all of these or how complicatedstrict theyshould be should be considered   If something doesnt need a way to describe a problem the model    and just data and the CLI it shouldnt have an unnecessary model    that adds to familiarization time   If you can reuse an existing data specification egJSONCSV for    structuredtabular data that cuts down on the barrier to entry    Though this shouldnt always be done as you may be trying to    squish an already existing data specification into a place it    doesnt belong   Maybe that command interface could be replacedsimplified into a    couple CLI flagsarguments instead of REPLcommand language like    many unix tools are like grepsedAMPL was moderately successful taught in university courses used as anoptimization tool in industryIt started as a purely declarative egSQL language that solved aparticular problem but gradually added the mechanism of programminglanguages conditionals loop functionsproceduresHowever it wasnt originally designed for that so adding all thosetrapping makes it a bit odd to read and syntax may not be where youexpectSidenote AMPL is proprietary  need to pay for it No one really wantedto go build a optimization solver for fun so a big open sourcealternative doesnt seem to existCase Study EQNTypeSets mathematical equations by piping into troff idea a languagethat matches the way mathematics is spoken x sub i equals pi intofancy looking documentsIs simpler than TexLaTeX but that can also work in your favor thatsomeone doesnt have to installconfigurelearn how it works Eg Ifits a simple command that works with pipes what you already know itseasy to integrateteach to people who know nothing about itCase Study PicTextual descriptions of line drawings think used for flow chartsThe first version of pic had no notion of loops or conditionals Butpeople needed it to do certain things so it got added with a horriblesyntaxOn machine generated input to your DSLIf the heavy lifting for your DSL can be handledpiped into by an wellestablished tool and you have relative certainty that it wont breakbecause of changes to the external tool there are lots of benefits toseparating the concerns of how to do the thing with what your thingdoesYour tool could just be an adjustment on an implementation of acomplicated algorithm or a simplification of the interface to thecomplex tool which then gets handled by the external toolIf an idea is good making it recursive makes it betterWhy languages succeed   solve real problems in a clearly better way       notation matters   culturally compatible and familiar       familiar syntax helps Clike       easy to get started with documentation        potable to new environments   environmentally compatible       isnt proprietarylimited behind hardware       can link to standard tools and libraries       is open source   weak competition no other language exists in this problem space   good luck or good advertising Eg C had good luck timing came about the time of mini computersthen got a new burst of life with workstations egSun then anotherburst with the PC then another with embedded systemsWhy languages fail to thrive   niche or domain disappears what happened with Pic when troff died   poor engineering       too big too complex too slow too late       incompatible with environments   poor philosophical choices       ideology over functionality       single programming paradigm       too mathematicaltheoretical maybe Functional Programming        falls into here for most people       too different

was topick one itd probably be elvishOil seems like an interesting project but its more about properlyparsing the POSIXbash AST and making shell code more secure Thecreator was previously working on Oil as an entirely new language buttheyve stopped development on that for nowThe Oil External Resources is great for finding alternatives though Ithas lots of peoples random extensions to shellsUnless something like Oil comes about which has full POSIX support butalso a large enough community that shell customization is a thing Idont think Im going to be replacing bashzsh anytime soonImproving PipelinesDisregarding portability I still think there could be tools to makeshelllike code better bash isnt great at processing text so thatswhy tools like awksed are used Learning how IFS arrays and loopswordline splitting work in bash does help a lot but theres stilltimes where things feels like a hack egusing curl and checking HTTPcodesCurrently what I typically do is just write another toolcreate analias with 5 pipelines with heavy use of sedawkxargs Thats okay forme but it isnt readable and its not great to debugmodifyOn a related note curl  jq to get some basic interaction with JSONAPIs is great but at some point when youre dealing with structureddata and doing conditional logic based on it trying to store individuallist items in shellbash variables gets to be really confusingAssociative arrays and arrays can work but it gets to be veryunreadable and you have no type safetyerror checking I tend to fallback to python in situations like thatSo at some point it may make sense to fall back onto for ascriptcall out to for command line pipelines other interpretedlanguages like pythonruby but thats typically a noticeable drop inspeed I do value the speed of the shell dont think Id use xonshinteractively though it does look cool and using minimal tools likecurljqOn one hand if there was a nicer extendible DSL like mario butwritten in something faster than python and didnt require me to usepipx to run it from a virtual environment which supported   processing text with convenience functions for typical string    operations   complex operations currently handled by curljq like making HTTP    requests parsing JSONXML   maintain a shell like DSLsyntax so you could construct pipelines    and receive text from STDIN and do mapfilterreduce across lines I could totally see myself using it for personalthrowaway scriptsOn the other hand at some point that DSL turns into its own interpretedlanguage and youre just rewriting ruby or python Often those toolsare written in python as well so your startup time is bad anywaysFor text manipulation I can see myself replacing trsedcutawk withperl see the perlre and perlrun man pages That has the benefit ofbeing portable and the startup time for perl is way better thanpythonruby so using it in pipelines is okay     hyperfine S sh perl S sh python S sh ruby         perl ran       1634  1022 times faster than python       2757  1538 times faster than rubypython in particular has tons of great libraries so it can often be thesolution see my giturl script for gitopenBut otherwise Im in this middle ground of having to make a decisionbetween funky looking bash pipelines and flawed data structures anddecreasing performance by calling out to a larger library in pythonsomeother languageI really like the brevity of pipes so mariolike projects whichapproach the problem by creating a small DSL which acts on STDIN is whatI want but I cant seem to find one that meets my criteriaWhen writing throwaway commands I often find myself doingsome command  xargs I  sh c  or creating a bash script whichreads from STDIN to a while loop  to do multiple subshells out togrepsed against each lineBut Im not totally satisfied with that and I wish there was a betterwayPossible Solutions   Find something that works like mario but not in python and is    extendible or go through the arduous task of writing something    myself in gorust   Hope for an interactive shell which is a superset of the POSIX    standard while providing convenience functions like elvish to become    semipopularThe More I think about this more likely me writing the tool isnt goingto be a thingI think theres a possibility to write something in a fast language likerust to do thisIt would be similar to mario but the ability to write arbitraryfunctions wouldnt be as possible Theres an argument to be made to useperl instead since thats sort of what perl was made for butaesthetically I dont like the syntax of perl and doing morecomplicated stream processing like jqawkasync curling isnt possibleThings that this WOULDNT support because good tools already exist   JSON jq and gron   curl though argument could be made that curl isnt the best at    thisAt that point the custom tools youre writing are replaceable by acouple jqawkperl pipelines and itd be more code to write some customsolution Nice thing about mario is that you have access to the pythonstdlib and common string manipulation functions which is what thecustom tool I write would offer over awkjq And nice string handling inthe shell is needed its often sort of hacky to fix strings in theshell though zn is niceSo the solution for one liners is learn perl which I have been doinguse gronjq all fallback to python when necessaryyq analogous to jq for yamlXMLpyp is a nice replacement for basic awksed tasks instead of mario Itproviding python syntax to pipes Not portable but its very light andgood for quick scriptsFor CSVTSV q is sort of interesting lets you run SQL like statementsq SELECT COUNT FROM clicksfilecsv WHERE c3  323For larger pipelines riko tries to model Yahoo PipesTODO Is something to be said about writing a full shelllike lisplanguage because shells are hacky and writing languages is fun butthats a whole nother project on its own httpsngslangorg looks interestingOne way to think about NGS is bash plus data structures plus better syntax and error handlingIt has lots of utility functions and is fast at dealing with streams ofdata Looks like an awk for the modern times Examples Might be nice touse instead of a complex jqgrongrepcut Agree with a lot of theproblems laid out in this blog post Of all the tools on this pagehighest chance of me using thishttpsgithubcomnushellnushell It doesnt supportfunctionsvariables though so doubt it could be used for now Theconcept of pipes being tagged with types of data is very nice though Isa bit similar to httpsgithubcomliljencrantzcrush which canconvert between namespaces This seems like a lot of work though Sincecoreutils are essentially reimplementedreunderstoodencoded intolanguage specific data it means that the nice features you get fromtype tagging are placed behind days of workhttpsgithubcomgeophilemarcel seems quite nice for doing simplethrowaway scripts in pythonish format It allows me to reach out topython when needed for functionsdata structures while stillproviding some custom operators like  and a cleaner map for workingon streams of data Relatively high chance of using this as wellhttpsgithubcommodernishmodernish seems cool All written in sh soinstalling itavailability isnt generally an issue It hardens lotsof typical commands egwgetgitcut and provides more modern syntaxlike     usrbinenv modernish     use safe k     use sysdircountfiles     use vararithcmp     use varloop so youre still writing sh it just provides you with lots of nicerlooking shells and handles common pitfalls with loopingquotingcontrolflowI generally understand most of the pifalls in POSIX at this point soswitching to it would only be for slightly faster developmentexperience and perhaps more safety Though this would mean scriptsarent as portable and I have to learn its syntaxCreate a DSLIf some task is done over and over in the shell maybe I should insteadwrite a DSL to handle that task See Brian Kernighan

includes a call to a subshell which could fail Forexample    declare myvarcommand       0   returnwill always succeed since the declare returns a 0 exit codeShould instead do    declare myvar    myvarcommand       0When a script gets large enough you may start separating parts intofunctions That means that an exit that may have previously existedwouldnt exit the script but instead the function Those should beconverted to return and then the main invocation to the function shouldbe d or    0d against This also leads itself well toexporting functions in bash for interactive useSo it makes more sense to create a main or toplevel function thatincludes your entire script like    main        z 1           echo error 2        return 1              main   exit For short scripts that just once from top to bottom thats slightoverkill but once youre doing lots of getoptsvalidation or have asufficient amount of functionality it makes sense to do thatChecking Return ValuesInstead of explicitly checking  to check the error code you can usean if statement or just a  with curly brackets    if  mv something somewhere then      echo Error couldnt move something      exit 1    fi     or    if  someerrormv something somewhere then      echo someerror      exit 1    fi     or    mv something somewhere        echo Error couldnt move something      exit 1    Bash also has PIPESTATUS that lets you check the return code from everypart of a pipe    tar cf     cd dir  tar xf      if  PIPESTATUS0  0  PIPESTATUS1  0  then      echo Unable to tar files to dir 2    fiAnother alternative if youre pipelining text is to use xargs r whichdoesnt run if the STDIN is empty which is typically the case if acommand failed    somecommandthatmightprintnothing  xargs r I  echo Notes from

programmingproblems such as the symbolic differentiation and integration ofalgebraic expressions Lisp was not the product of a concerted designeffort Instead it evolved informally in an experimental manner inresponse to users needs and to pragmatic implementationconsiderationsLisps were used in applications where efficiency is not the primaryconcern For example for operatingsystem shell languages and extensionlanguagesSICP p 34An extension language is a programming language interpreter offered byan application program so that users can write macros or evenfullfledged programs to extend the

access the extension language datastructures SourceMeans by which programming languages combine simple ideas to form morecomplex ones   primitive expressions  the most basic data types and entities the    language operates on   means of combination  combinations of primitives   means of abstraction  where combinations can be named and    manipulatedIn general programming can be described as procedures and data data isthe stuff we want to operate on and procedures are rules to manipulateitIn general   Infix Notation 34   Prefix Notation sin 2   Postfix Notation 7Primitive ExpressionsSTK

matters the right one is usedProcedures get called from left to right inside out with fewexceptions One of the exceptions is define at the time the statementis run the name egpisquare dont exist Define is a keyword for aspecial formFormally1  Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination2  Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression    the operator to the arguments that are the values of the other    subexpressions the operandsThe REPL itself is recursive in nature since step 2 enforces thatsubexpressions must be evaluated firstdefine name formal parameters

ApplicativeOrder ExecutionNormalOrder can be thought of as fully expand and reduce in contrastto ApplicativeOrder evaluate the arguments and then applyFor the example   5 3  5 3ApplicativeOrder would evaluate  5 3 twice separately and thenevaluate the resulting  15 15 while ApplicativeOrder would evaluatethe first  5 3 and then substitute the result from the first to thesecond This avoids multiple evaluations of the same expression and iswhat Lisp usesThe difference between normal and applicative order doesnt make a lotof difference when youre procedure is a function always give the sameresult but the expanding means that argument expressions aresubstituted in subexpressions instead of the resulting valueFor example if you had    STk define zero z  z z    zeroAnd called something like zero random 10In ApplicativeOrder the result from random 10 PRNG would be passedto zero so the expression would always result in  n n  0 InNormalOrder the random 10 would expand and the entire expressionwould be passed to zero before evaluation which would result inzero random 10  random10 random10and then evaluate the two random10s will most of the time generatedifferent numbers making zero return something that isnt zero makingzero not a function but still a procedureOnce your procedures arent functional Normal vsApplicative mattersConditionals    x          x if x  0        0 if x  0        x if x  0    aka case analysis can be represented in Lisp like    define abs x        cond  x 0 x                     x 0 0                     x 0  xIn general conditionals can be represented like    cond p1 e1                p2 e2                                pn enwhich have n clauses each with a predicate p and expression ePredicates are evaluated in order and short circuit If none of thepredicates evaluate to true the value of cond is undefinedIts convention to end defined predicates helper functions that evaluatetruthyness in a question markAnother way to write the abs function    define abs x        cond  x 0  x                    else xelse is a symbol used in place of a predicate which describes whathappens when all previous clauses evaluate to falseYou can also use if    define abs x        if  x 0                 x xwhose general form looks likeif predicate consequent alternativeYou can also use the logical operations   and e1 e2  en   or e1 e2  en   not eSimilar to cond and and or short circuitExamples    define  x y or  x y  x y    define  x y or  x  y  x y    or x  5 x  10  and x  5 x  10Procedures bind their variables to locally scoped bound

statically types language because in someClike language    int x the int defines what type of value youre looking at and thecorresponding machine instructions ADD FLOATADD that should be usedto represent that The data itself has no clue what type it is it mustbe used with the type definition This can be used when using subclassesto slice off attributes called Object SlicingType tagging worsens runtime since for each operation the interpreterhas to find out what types its looking at and do some comparisons whilethe compiler takes care of that at compile time for a compiled languageIn your functions you can then do a cond against the first element inthe list and dispatching on the type This may improvereadabilitydebugging However this also requires that everyone workingon a system tag their data and tagsfunction names for different typescant conflict Book calls this conventional style grouping verbsegarea for ngons and conding against the data typeHowever Implementing generic interfaces is not additive A personcreating the selectorsgeneric procedures cant know what type of ADTwill be passed into ithow to deal with it so it couldnt dispatch Tomodularize this further to allow that we useDataDirected ProgrammingInstead of changing functions to dispatch to specific functions based ontypes the actions and types of data are built into a global lookuptable that can be modified at runtimeThat way you can insert item into a table indexed by operationtype where item is some function that does the operation for thetype without ever modifying the base codeIn order to create a new package one would the functions which act onyour data type and then put references to that function into the globaltable If trying to create generic methods which act on any type youcan get the function from the global tableThe table returns false if it couldnt find a method for that data typein the global lookup tableData Directed programming isnt just this lookup table pattern its thegeneral pattern of describing functionality in your program by storingsome procedurevalue somewhere Same thing is done by any programnowadays with a config fileMessage PassingThis differs from data driven programming inInstead of using intelligent operations that dispatchswitch on datatypes we use intelligent data objects that dispatch on operationsnames The data type includes the functions which act on itself so allwe need to do an operation is to pass the name of a message to a datatypeProcedures are customdefined on top of the constructors data eg    define makesquare side      lambda message        cond eq message area           side side        eq message side          side        else error Unknown messageThe side variable is baked into the new function definition whenmakesquare is calledMessage Passing can sort of be thought as a precursor to object orientedprogrammingSystems with Generic OperationsUsing the above data driven approach you can make types in a languageby defining a table of valid operations for each type That gives yougood control dispatching functions to particular functions and allowsusers of your library to extend it by adding their own functions to theglobal tableCrossType OperationsYou could static define relationships between how to add numbers fromone type to another but this possesses the same problem as before  itcant be done additivelyAlso not clear where should the operation be put  some third packagethat defines the relationship between two other types Put it in one ofthe packages bothType CoercionInstead of trying to implement procedures for each operation across eachn types we can add structure into the type system which describes howto coerce types Procedures which coerce between types could be added toanother coercion table and then the generic functions can check to seeif types are the same else try to coerce w getcoercion from a tob else from b to a else errorHierarchies of typesTo make describing the relationships between types clearer languagesoften come with a global structure that describes how built in typesrelate to one another Representing one type as a subtype of anotherimplies one can coerce from one to anotherA tower of subtypes where one is a subtype of another and so on iscalled a tower As an exampleinteger  rational  real  complexSpecifying types as towers reduces the amount of type coercions you haveto define since the transitive property allows integers to coerce tocomplex without explicit definitions Other users can also add typeswith one coercion function to integer which then means it can coerce toall the super types in the towerInadequacies of hierarchiesIf your type system isnt a tower but rather is a graph where typesare much more complex a type might have multiple super types So theresmultiple ways to raise a type How to implement a type system whichcan resolve raising types while allowing modularity is still an area ofresearch"

    "text": "Read Section 31 32Read Object Oriented Programming  Below the line viewEncompasses Lecture 21 22 23Modularity  can be divided naturally into coherent parts that can beseparately developed and maintainedOrganizational Strategies   Objects  views a large system as a collection of distinct objects    whose behaviours may change over time Have to be concerned with how    objects can change but still maintain its identity   Streams  information flows by applying operations onto data Can be    exploited to apply operations lazily delayed evaluationAssignment and Local StateIn a system composed of many objects the objects are rarely completelyindependent A system composed of separate objects is most useful whenstate variables of the system can be grouped into closely coupledsystems that are only loosely coupled to other subsystems That allowsthe entire system to be modular and allows parts of the system to betested and debugged separately making maintenance easierIn scheme you can create local variables using the let keyword so thiswould sort of create a bank account object in an OOP sense byusing local scope and set    define newwithdraw    let balance 100      lambda amount        if  balance amount          begin set balance  balance amount            balance          Insufficient fundsnewwithdraw returns a lambda whose set refers to the locally definedbalanceSimilarly you could create a makeaccount procedure which returns adispatch method and use withdraw or deposit to set the local balancevariableIntroducing statelocal variables causes lots of confusion and problemsbut it also simplifies otherwise complicated code Consider seeding arandom number generator If we cant save some initial seed value for aPRNG every operation that needs a random number will have to have theresult of the previous operation This leads you to passing around anadditional seedPRNG value everywhere else your methods are not purelyfunctional In haskell this confusion is typed with a monadIntroducing assignment means that you can no longer use the substitutionmodel It becomes harder to read code whose results can depend onmultiple mutable global variables No simple model with nicemathematical properties can be an adequate framework for dealing withobjects and assignment in programming languagesA language that supports the concept that equals can be substitutedfor equals in an expression without changing the value of theexpression is said to be referentially transparent Once you includeset youve violated referential transparency The meaning of samebecomes much harder to modelCompare    define peteracc makeaccount 100    define paulacc makeaccount 100vs    define peteracc makeaccount 100    define paulacc peteraccThis demonstrates the difference between comparing objects by value vsidentityIn general so long as we never modify data objects we can regard acompound data object to be precisely the totality of its piecesIn imperative programming since were not following the substitutionmodel the order of operations becomes much more important and itspossible to get incorrect answers by not considering how the order ofoperations affects local state of complex systems This becomes evenworse if operations execute in parallel since its not always easy todetermine which operations depend on each otherEnvironment Model of EvaluationAn environment is a sequence of frames Each frame is a table possiblyempty of bindings which associate variable bindings with values Eachframe points to a higher enclosing environment except the globalframeThe value of a variable refers to the closest frame which include abinding to the symbol If no frames include a binding its said to beunboundSimple environment structureIf in scope II xs value would be 7 The binding in II is said toshadow the binding of x to 3 in IFor simplicity you can think of the global environment as the highestscope which includes bindings like  or  which represent builtinsymbolsRules for evaluationFor a procedure like    define square      lambda x  x x the square symbol is then defined globally Calling a lambda bodycreates a frame which then has a pointer to the environment it wasdefined inFunction ScopeIn general define creates definitions by adding bindings to framesTo apply a procedure to arguments create a new environment containing aframe that binds the parameters to the values of the arguments Theenclosing environment of this frame is the environment specified by theprocedure the enclosing frame of where the procedure was definedThe Environment Model can be summarized by two rules   A procedure object is applied to a set of arguments by constructing    a frame binding the formal parameters of the procedure to the    arguments of the call and then evaluating the body of the procedure    in the context of the new environment constructed The new frame has    as its enclosing environment the environment part of the procedure    object being applied   A procedure is created by evaluating a sexpr lambda relative to a    given environment The resulting procedure object is a pair    consistent of the text of the sexpr and a pointer to the environment    in which the procedure was createdVery simply   Substitution Model eval expr   Environment Model eval expr environIn scheme define lets you create bindings and set allow us to modifybindings In the substitution model theres often an implicit thirdeviron argument which would be theglobalenv the global framemakewithdraw environmentRunning makewithdraw multiple times would create separate environmentsso the balance binding would use its own framescope while executingThe amount is the formal parameter to the method which is created eachtime the function is called It points to the E1 frame which includesthe balance binding which points to the global frameThe symbolscode that describe the parameters and body do not depend orchange when the values in each account do so they can be keptseparately and shared across instances Whether or not they actually areis an implementation detail since it wouldnt change the result itwould be an optimization that reduces memory usageW1 and W2 share parametersbodyThis method of symbol lookup is called lexical scoping An alternativewould be dynamic where the lookup is determined by the most recentenvironment on the stack in a specific procedure call which has a formalparameter with the same symbol name Dynamic scoping is much harder tooptimize since lookups are done at runtime Lexical scoping can allowyou to do some optimizations it allows you to know the offsets forbinding lookups relative to the memory address of their environment atcompile timeTwo key properties that make local procedure definitions a usefultechnique for modularizing programs   The names of local procedures do not interfere with names external    to the enclosing procedure because the local procedure names will    be bound in the frame that the procedure creates when it is run    rather than being bound in the global environment   The local procedure can access the arguments of the enclosing    procedure simply by using the parameter names as free variables    variables not defined as a formal parameter to a procedure This    is because the body of the local procedure is evaluated in an    environment that is subordinate to the environment for the enclosing    procedureThis often means that local procedure definitions which deal with stateare easier to read and work how you expect them to since theyrepointing at the correct framesWe could say that the environments that are created when lambdas are runare closures Could be said that all bindings are just closures in someglobal frame whose values are stored as a binding in the globalclosure Which is true but we often dont think of it that way sinceits not incredibly helpfulMessage PassingAny OOP system that uses the messagepassing model must have somebelowtheline mechanism for associating methods with messages This istypically done by binding a symbolnameIf we are treating objects as an ADT programs that use objectsshouldnt know that we happen to be representing objects as proceduresThis can be fixed by wrapping the dispatch procedure    if method method      apply method args      error No method message cadr methodInheritance and DelegationIt may make sense that all parent methods would just be copied into thechild when a class is created but it typically isnt done that way Itsdone through delegation  each object contains only the methods for itsown class and then a instance variable of the parent class If themethods arent found in the child class it passes a message to theparent class which then passes to its parent if it cant find thesymbolTypically the parent class instance variable is created when the classis defined and would be shared across instancesA downside of the delegation approach at least in MITSchemes basicimplementation is a parent class doesnt have access to local statedefined in a child class"
