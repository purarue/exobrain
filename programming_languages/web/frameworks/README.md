Title: CSS/JS Frameworks
---

* CSS Frameworks
  * Obvious mention of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - more utility focused
* JavaScript
  * [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) (Largest community support, which is nice)
    * [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) - React based, (can handle frontend/backend). Isn't as mature, but nice for basic routing on SSGs.
  * [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) - compiled from its own JSX-like language, handles basic state for animation/interactivity nicely without complex state management
  * [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/) - mainly for animation/basic requests, but `fetch`/`CSS3` could probably replace this
  * [`Vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/) - feel like the compile step doesn't do as much as it should, would rather use `Svelte`
