As described by beepb00p:

Exobrain, or “second brain”, or “brain dump” is something like public
wiki where you can keep your notes, ideas and thoughts. Other people can
search in your exobrain without having to physically interact with you.

I use mine to store notes from books, videos, list resources, along with
anything else I don’t want to forget.

Some of the more complete notes are converted to blog posts eventually.

Head to the sitemap or blog feed for whats on here.

TODO:

-   Still to to implement the searching feature, planning on
    periodically caching the rendered MD files in a genserver on my
    elixir server to fuzzy match against the pages here :)

Inspired by beepb00p, structure/build tooling modified from rwx.gg
