Title: Searching on pixiv
---

Wierd hack to sorta sort by populairty on [pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/) without a membership.

It sorts it by the number of stars (like likes)

Search for something like 10000users入りor 5000users入り and then the japanese name of the show:

ユーリ!!! on ICE

Which you can find on MAL if you don't know its best to go 10000users入り ユーリ!!! on ICE, then 5000users入り ユーリ!!! on ICE, then 1000users入り ユーリ!!! on ICE, as you usually find the best stuff.
