Title: CSS/JS Frameworks
---

- CSS Frameworks
  - Obvious mention of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - more utility focused
- JavaScript
  - Bundling:
    - [`babel`](https://babeljs.io/) - transcompile JS to older version of JS. (ES6 -> back)
    - [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) - bundler
    - [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/) - faster, webpack alternative (less supported though)
  - Frameworks
    - [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) (Largest community support, which is nice)
      - [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) - React based, (can handle frontend/backend). Isn't as mature, but nice for basic routing on SSGs.
      - Tools:
        - [`react-router`](https://reactrouter.com/)
        - [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx/) (shorthand for ternary class names/styling)
        - [`react-loading-skeleton`](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton) - grey bars while loading page content
    - [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) - compiled from its own JSX-like language, handles basic state for animation/interactivity nicely without complex state management
    - [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/) - mainly for animation/basic requests, but `fetch`/`CSS3` could probably replace this
    - [`Vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/) - feel like the compile step doesn't do as much as it should, would rather use `Svelte`
