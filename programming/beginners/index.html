If you have a clear idea in mind, sometimes you don’t need to do all of the tutorial, just some of it<p>This really depends on what you want to do. As is the case with most difficult problems, the answer is ‘It depends’.<p>Nowadays, if you don’t want to go straight to <code>C</code> to learn the fundamentals (which is probably what I would recommend), <code>JavaScript</code> is a good first language; there are lots of CLI tools written in it, it teaches you lots of the basics and you can transition to web if you want.<p><a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> is free, and offers nice context.<p>Otherwise, to get a general understanding of programming and problem solving in general, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM&amp;list=PLhQjrBD2T3828ZVcVzEIhsHVgjANGZveu">CS50 Harvard course</a> is great.<p>For webdev, the quality may vary from project to project, but <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> and <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">theodinproject</a> are worth a mention.<p>For giant lists of resources, check out <a href="https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning">project-based-learning</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#contents">awesome.re</a>.<p>I will stress this again. I’m listing tutorials here, but the best way to learn is application - make something. You need tutorials to get started and have some context, but your loop should be: Learn something, take notes, apply it, and perhaps to keep yourself accountable - put it out there somewhere (e.g. on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>). Else, you risk just watching tutorials and feeling this sense of accomplishment copying code down without gaining the underlying problem solving skills.</div></main><footer><p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode"id="copyright">© 2020 Sean Breckenridge.
