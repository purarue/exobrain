This leaves the code open, allowing other parts of the company to reference (no ‘silos’)<p>Typically, this uses a software forge of some kind. Maybe Github, or some corporate alternative.<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3><ul><li>Higher quality code<li>Improved knowledge sharing<li>Higher (arguably?) employee satisfaction<li>More of a meritocracy, code is merged based on merit and not decided on during private meetings<li>People may develop the code for the same functionality in different parts of the company, separating it (maybe 80%?) into a shared code base means less work. Teams can then finish the 20% themselves, and those products can be marketed/sold differently. The shared code is the ‘platform organization’:<ul><li>Profit center - Important because it your product brings in money<li>Cost Center - i.e. R/D, costs the company money but is worth for other reasons</ul></ul><pre><code>[ Product  1    ] [ Product  2    ] ...
[ Profit Center ] [ Profit Center ] ...
      |                   |
      |                   |
      |                   |

|       (Platform Organization)    |
|             Cost Center          |
|----------------------------------|</code></pre><p>In this structure, even though the platform organization is 80% of the product, its often treated as a cost center, and therefore has less developers, and discriminated/unliked by others/marketing.<p>The alternative is:<pre><code>[ Product  1    ] [ Product  2    ] ...
[ Profit Center ] [ Profit Center ] ...
