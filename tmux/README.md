Title: Tmux Notes
---

See <https://sean.fish/d/tmux.conf?dark> for my config

prefix : to bring up tmux command prompt
prefix ; to swap between panes
prefix , to rename current window
prefix $ to rename current session

For scrolling, enabling mouse mode means scrolling automatically throws you into copy mode, else `prefix [`, then vim keys. Can also just to `prefix PageUp` to enter and scroll up. See <https://superuser.com/a/209608/887225>.
