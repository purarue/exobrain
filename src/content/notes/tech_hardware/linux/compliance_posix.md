[Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) when it was released was made for business and was incredibly expensive, its `minix`, and later `linux`/`bsd`-variants that made this free.

From [`lastmiles`](https://twitch.tv/lastmiles): Solaris is a AT&T System V Release 4 based port of UNIX to a commercial implementation with full SUSv2 and SUSv3 spec compliance. Therefore its a good test bed for software compliance.

See [Second-System Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) - trying to create better systems but spending forever adding all the features you want and never releasing anything.
