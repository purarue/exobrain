Technology:

- A film camera? With not terribly expensive film? Does this exist?
- I want to build a [cyberdeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcaQMXYRKSg)!, preferably something larger using some of the spare [SOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) I already have, in a [hard camera case](https://www.amazon.com/hard-camera-case/s?k=hard+camera+case) so its upgradade-able and I can swap out parts?

Books:
