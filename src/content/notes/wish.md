Technology:

- flipper zero
- A film camera? With not terribly expensive film? Does this exist?
- I want to build a [cyberdeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcaQMXYRKSg)!, preferably something larger using spare [SOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) I already have/parts found at thrift store, in a [hard camera case](https://www.amazon.com/hard-camera-case/s?k=hard+camera+case) so its upgradade-able and I can swap out parts?

Tools:

- a small block plane for woodworking (find one secondhand somewhere?), or if I want to get a larger one, a number 4
- [a cabinet scraper](https://youtu.be/-3SgDTOg1GA?t=257)
- a book press for bookbinding
- sliding t bevel
- a whittling knife (though, I am pretty happy using my swiss army knife for now, it would just be a luxury) - probably a flexcut knife set

Clothes:

- a leather jacket
- a flowy layered black midi dress
