title: First Order Retreivability
---

From [here](https://www.republicofmovement.com/blog/6zfehtp4kaxin9qno4zb2mqdsioqak):

> In his book “Every tool is a hammer”, Adam Savage explains his concept of “first order retrievability”. There, it is in the context of running a workshop - any tool you will use should be immediately accessible from the place from which you work.

A thought from Adam Savage on how he designs his toolboxes/workshop, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxko8OhUv7s)

For doing shop improvements, constantly noting any friction he encounters during his work. It's hard to be aware of these moments afterwards, so you have to remember to take note of them when working, Then, mull on trying to find a solution for weeks or something months, then try and fix it.

That leads to better optimizations than trying to statically analyze your situation/workshop.
