title: Notes/Journaling
---

Even though I have little scripts to let me create journal entries on my computer, and a couple to process vlogs/voice memos into text, I also use analog to capture a lot of what I think because there's often less mental overhead than opening my computer, getting distracted and losing the thought. Also, I just write much slower using hand, which gives me more time to think about what Im writing

So, I carry around little pocket notebooks (often just one, sometimes two)

- "Idea catchall" (pocket notebook)  he calls it, I tend to call mine [grasp](https://github.com/karlicoss/grasp)/[scratch](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Interaction.html) after the emacs tools (even though I dont use emacs). I reflect on this/write TODOs/notes/feelings in one notebook, and then periodically digitize if I need to, or copy over to other notebooks where they belong. That might seem like a lot of wasted time, but I tend to rewrite/refine the notes as I copy over, so my grasp acts as a super-rough draft. This is intentionally disorganized to make friction for writing notes as close to zero as possible.
- Diary (pocket notebook): present(ish)-day time-bound emotions, 'desire-like', world-to-mind feelings/aspirations/wants/fears. Anything that I want to get out of my head and onto paper. If I feel like it warrants one, sometimes will write out a post in my Journal. Often this will also be a vlog/voice memo instead, because I feel like I don't want to lose a feeling/thought before I have time to write it down, so I just record myself
- Journal (large notebook): more well formatted, describing specific (recent or past) events and how I felt about things, memories/how I remember things in childhood. This is somewhat obviously not ordered, they are just written when a distinct memory surfaces.
- [Commonplace Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book): for notes about factual things, quotes, facts, research that Ive done; things that exist in the world and aren't my own thoughts - unlike the video, I tend to use my exobrain (this website), or just create a file in my ~/Documents folder. For larger ideas that I might want to think out, I might use my grasp notebook and then digitize into my exobrain later

To summarize:

- grasp [small]: rough thoughts, todos, notes, quotes, feelings, etc.
- diary [small]: present-day emotions, vlogs/voice memos
- journal [large]: written out memories, current-day journal entries/feelings
- exobrain [phone/computer]: fact-related notes, research, quotes, etc
