Not really sure I fully understand this yet, but following:

https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim/blob/main/USAGE.md#user-content-fn-1-3038f027f468e862d37370e264a7e196

Using `diffview.nvim`, after checking out using `gh pr checkout <id>`:

```
DiffviewOpen origin/main --imply-local=true
```

opens the diff between them `g?` for commands, `gco` or `gcb` (or something like that?) to select which diff to use
