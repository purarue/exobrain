## safari.db -wal file

Had lots of trouble absorbing the `-wal` file, I thought I was running a checkpoint through `sqlitebrowser` but apparently it wasn't doing anything?

Running `sqlite History.db` through terminal and `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint;` and then `Ctrl+D` like described in the comment [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19575935/9348376) finally ended up working

## concurrent writes

See [here](https://sean.fish/s/OYbh) for some code I used to test concurrent writes/locking/timeouts with sqlite

## concurrent reads

[yc post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32579866) has some cool notes about enabling WAL mode to get better concurrent reads
