This is following the book [here](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf), and the lecture series [here](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter).

[List of URLs here](https://gist.github.com/seanbreckenridge/7e714fc4dc34bcdfea5038114ee8816f) which can be downloaded with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) like `yt-dlp -a ./urls.txt`

Thanks to [creactiviti/scip-course](https://github.com/creactiviti/sicp-course) for a nice overview.

### Install STk for Mac

You can install STk (REPL for [Scheme](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)>)) from [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~scheme/precompiled/OSX/).

This requires X11, so; on Mac:

`brew cask install xquartz`

You can now run `stk`, or `stk-simply` (the version with extra functions used in the lectures)

On Arch Linux, this can be installed with `pacman -S mit-scheme`
