A list of online programming classes/courses I've watched/taken.

### Havard CS50

Very nice introduction and possibly refresher to lots of relevant computer science concepts. Goes over Scratch, C, HTTP/HTML, Python, JavaScript, Basic Web Programming, and SQL. More importantly, its not focused on the language, it rightfully stresses the problem solving, how to think/abstract problems and to use the right tool/language for the job.

### MIT Missing Semester

<https://missing.csail.mit.edu/>

Covers proficiency with programming tools. That means shell, editor, data wrangling, and your tooling. If you've never invested time in this, this is a great course. If you've invested some time, you'll probably pick up a couple tools and tricks.
