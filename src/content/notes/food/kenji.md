some notes from the Q&A:

Wooden boards:

- boos block cutting board
- wood has some natural antibacterial properties, has some give for your knife, and you can sand them down if they get really destroyed (also, no microplastics)
- condition if they get dry/seem to get stained or are just absorbing water

If I ever do get a induction stove, for wok cooking can get a portable butane burners around 15000 BTU range

cleaning:

- woks: heating on high, add water and scrub to clean
- cast iron: don't use abrasives (metal) or chemical micro abrasives (pink stuff), but you can use some soap to clean cast iron, just make sure to dry it immediately and not leave any water in it, heat it on low to dry and season with some oil (this builds up layers of oil polymers, which creates a nonstick surface)

sharpening:

- for expensive knives, should use a wetstone
- for cheap knives, can use one of the pull through sharpeners
- the metal rod (honing) corrects microscopic inconsistencies which make it hard to pull through food, you should be using that multiple times in between sharpening
