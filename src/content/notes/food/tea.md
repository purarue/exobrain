title: Tea
---

Just a list of tea I generally like and don't

Good:

- English Breafast
- Earl Grey, also great with honey (sunflower, typically) and lemon. (Viennese also good, means I dont have to add lemon as its already acidic)
- Sencha green tea
- Soba (Buckwheat) tea
- Samovar Tea (I think this is the tea I grew up with, drinking iced tea)

To try:

- Gyokuro

### Spiced Chai Recipe

Growing up in India used to drink this all the time. This is the recipe I've landed on after years of experimenting.

- 1 star anise (dried)
- 2 green cardamom pods (prefer the actual stuff, grinded doesn't give it the same taste), cut open
- ginger (about 1/5th of a root), minced; don't have to peel it
- [optional] 1/10 of a stick of cinnamon (I just break off a piece), or ground cinnamon
- [optional] full or ground cloves

1. put all of whole spices and ginger into a pot of cold water on the stove on high till its boiling
1. once water looks a bit cloudy/spices are infused, reduce heat and add tea (I use English breakfast) and wait a few minutes till its whatever strength you want
1. add ground spices
1. strain into cups and add milk/sugar
