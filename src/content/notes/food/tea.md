Spiced Tea Recipe

Growing up in India used to drink this all the time. Sometimes will have 4-6 cups of this a day, have it all the time

- 1 star anise (dried)
- 2 green cardamom pods (prefer the actual stuff, grinded makes it taste grainy), cut open
- ginger (about 1/5th of a root), minced; don't have to peel it
- [optional] 1/10 of a stick of cinnamon (I just break off a piece)

1. put all of the above in a pot of cold water on the stove on high till its boiling
1. then put it tea (I use english breakfast) and wait till its whatever strength you want
1. add milk and sugar to make it chai, if you want
