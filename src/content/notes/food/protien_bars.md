title: Protien Bars
---

I like to carry a protien bar around with me in case I get hungry, so that Im not tempted to eat something much worse

A lot of these are sweetened with sugar alcohol, which feel like they affect my gut a bit in larger quantities. Probably not going to hit those unless Im eating 2+ of these bars a day, but I also dont like the taste of sweet things that much that I crave sugar alcohol as a replacement, so might as well just pick something that isn't sweet.

I do not really care about taste, as long as the texture is not terrible (am okay with some flakiness). A lot of these bars double as candy bar replacements which Im not really into, too much sugar for me.

Ideally, Id get something with 15-20g of protien, some amount of fibre, no sugar alcohol, and no more than about 5g of sugar.

ones to try:

- aloha bars (these use monkfruit)
  - chocolate mint
  - peanut butter chocolate chip
  - chocolate fudge brownie
  - chocolate chip cookie dough
  - vanilla almond crunch
  - lemon cashew (5/10, not enough lemon)
  - coconut chocolate (7/10 tastes good, but 7g of saturated fat)
- protien bars

here are ones Ive tested:

good-ish, but not something I love:

- misfits choc protien bar (15g protien, 5g fibre, 1g sugar alcohol)
- barebells caramel cashew protien bar (20g protien, 3g fibre, 5g sugar alcohol)

too sweet, these are essentially eating candy bars and I dont need that much saturated fat or sweetness:

- pure protien (9g sugar alcohol, 19g protien, 0g fibre)
- quest protien bars
- mre trail mix bar

not enough protien:

- rxbar: 12g protien, 9g fat (mostly from nuts/chocolate) - I like the taste of these, but they're not really a protien bar by my standards
- clif bars: ~10g protien, 5g fibre, 20g sugar - these are more like a granola bar, and I dont really want that much sugar
- core bat blueberry almond

ones Im not going to try:

- clif builders - these have way too much sugar/saturated fat for me
