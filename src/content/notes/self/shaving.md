title: DE Shaving Razors
---
I use a double-edged safety razor

metal impact:

- platinum - imrpoves durability, how many times you can use it
- tungsten - reduces corrosion, keeps sharp longer in humid environments
- chromium - improves sharpness for closer shave

brands to try:

- Astra: (what Im currently going to try once I get rid of the other random ones I have)
- Feather platinum coated: more sharp, so less passes, if I find the current ones too dull
- Wilkinson: if feather is too sharp, should be better for sensitive skin
