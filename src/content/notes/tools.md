title: Tools
---

This describes a lot of the tools I use in my [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/purarue/dotfiles)

This is an ever evolving list of tools and scripts I use and recommend, or combinations of tools I use to optimize my workflow.

Most of these are command line based, I wrap a lot of them in scripts [here](https://github.com/purarue/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/scripts) and in my [`pura-utils`](https://github.com/purarue/pura-utils) scripts repo

For other stuff I might be using, see [my github stars](https://github.com/purarue?direction=desc&sort=stars&tab=stars)

- Shells
  - [`zsh`](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) - for the [`fish`](https://fishshell.com/)-like [highlighting and auto completion](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete). Manually configuring everything makes this much faster than the monstrous `oh-my-zsh`
  - bash/[`dash`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dash) - for shell scripting. My `zsh` setup is also much more dependent on external plugins, so I don't use that on servers, I just stick to bash there. My [`bootstrap`](https://github.com/purarue/bootstrap/) script sets up new bash servers for me nicely, see [this post](../../blog/server-setup/) for more info
- Terminal
  - [`wezterm`](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html), which I've customized some:
    - a special [`cat`](https://github.com/purarue/dotfiles/blob/8457f501779f6eefccef14a9551c1eeafe0d629e/.config/zsh/progressive_enhancement.zsh#L72-L107) alias which lets me `cat` images and directories, while in the terminal

### OS-stuff

- [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/)
  - Window Manager: `i3-gaps` - not amazing but covers all my usecases and have everything configured nicely. `qtile` had some graphical issues for bad GUI apps, and I don't feel like messing up my `haskell` installation for `xmonad`
  - [`i3lock`](https://i3wm.org/i3lock/) for screen lock; [daemon process](https://purarue.xyz/d/lock-screen?redirect) caches pixelated version of screen to speed up start time. [Corresponding service file](https://purarue.xyz/d/lockscreen@.service?redirect) to lock my screen whenever my laptop suspends
  - [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) for launching applications and switching windows
  - [`dunst`](https://dunst-project.org/) for notifications, pretty normal configuration
  - [`autotiling`](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/autotiling) for automatic tiling
  - [`redshift`](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) to adjust color temperature
- Mac
  - I use [`skhd`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) as a hotkey daemon. My dotfiles are cross-platform, lots of scripts in [`cross-platform`](https://github.com/purarue/pura-utils#script-index) that handle switching on the OS to call out to platform-specific behavior (sending notifications, clipboard management, asking for user input)
- Android (using [termux](https://termux.dev/en/))

### Browsers

- [`floorp`](https://floorp.app/) (a firefox-fork) with extensions:
  - [`vimium-ff`](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/). Learning vimium has virtually killed the mouse for me. Especially the `f` binding, which highlights all clickable items and lets me click something with a keybind. I now sit feet away from my laptop with mechanical keyboard in hand, reaching over only for horrible sites which don't comply to the HTML standard (looking at you, clicking the `next episode` button on `Netflix`)
  - [`RES`](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-enhancement-suite/), to make reddit manageable, though I don't go to reddit much these days
  - [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) so I can add bits of JS to sites I want to fix
  - [Refined Github](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refined-github-/) for general Github improvements
  - [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), so I can dark mode common websites
  - [Sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) to skip ads in youtube videos
  - [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader), so I can dark mode every website I visit. Does have considerable overhead, so I prefer finding CSS through stylus for websites I visit often
  - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to block ads
- I use [`lynx`](https://www.lynxproject.org/) to do quick `duckduckgo` searches [without leaving the terminal](https://purarue.xyz/d/duck?redirect)/display some HTML nicely in the terminal (e.g. in [rread](https://purarue.xyz/d/rread?dark))

### General Workflow/Tools

- Editor: nvim using [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) for completion, [configured here](https://github.com/purarue/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim), mostly in lua
- Email [`neomutt`](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt) for email, using [mutt-wizard](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard) as a configuration layer to set it up
- RSS: [`newsraft`](https://codeberg.org/grisha/newsraft) for youtube/news/blogs. I have a [script](https://purarue.xyz/d/youtube-user-id?redirect) to grab a youtube users RSS feed, since youtube doesn't list that publicly. [`linkhandler`](https://purarue.xyz/d/linkhandler?redirect) lets me open youtube videos from `newsboat` using [`mpvf`](https://github.com/purarue/mpvf/) instead of visiting youtube in the browser
- Backups:
  - [SyncThing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) to Sync important directories across all my computers, and to my NAS
  - [restic](https://restic.net/) to a local drive, to have separate, offline, snapshots, using a [small script](https://purarue.xyz/d/restic-backup?redirect) to help manage all of that
- Todo list: [`todotxt`](http://todotxt.org/) for todos, with a [rofi interface](https://purarue.xyz/d/todo-prompt?redirect) as GUI, and [TUI](https://github.com/purarue/full_todotxt) for adding todos. The TUI I wrote forces lets me enter a deadline using plain english and converts it to a datetime, so is nice for quick reminders. [todotxt-more](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon/todotxt-more) has some great addons as well
- Calendar: [`calcurse`](https://github.com/lfos/calcurse) as a calendar, with my [`calcurse-load`](https://github.com/purarue/calcurse-load) hooks to add Google Calendar and `todo.txt` to calcurse automatically
- File Manager: a heavily customized [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) . See [`rifle.conf`](https://purarue.xyz/d/rifle.conf?redirect) (file handler) and [`scope.sh`](https://purarue.xyz/d/scope.sh?redirect) (previewer)
- Task Scheduler: bash script ([`bgproc`](https://github.com/purarue/bgproc)) with an infinite loop which runs in the background instead of `cron` (uses my [`evry`](https://github.com/purarue/evry) tool to schedule tasks)

### Media

- `mpv` to listen/watch media in general, integrated with my file manager ([ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger))/playlist manager and just through a basic [`list-music`](https://github.com/purarue/pura-utils/blob/main/shellscripts/list-music)/[`play-music`](https://purarue.xyz/d/play-music?dark) script from the terminal
- Music:
  - [`beets`](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) to organize/tag my music; [config file](https://purarue.xyz/d/.config/beets/config.yaml?redirect)
  - my `bash` [terminal playlist manager](https://github.com/purarue/plaintext-playlist) using `fzf`/`mpv` to store playlists for local music in local text files
- Images/Video:
  - For basic image cropping, I use [`pinta`](https://www.pinta-project.com/), for tiny bits of markup/highlighting I might use [flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) or [gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).
  - For general image manipulation tasks I create lots of small [`imagemagick`](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) scripts to do random resizes/converts. I have a larger script to [convert videos to gifs](https://github.com/purarue/pura-utils/blob/main/shellscripts/gifme), and use [`gifsicle`](https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle) for manipulating gifs
  - Lots of small [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) scripts to convert between video formats.
  - For trimming video, I use an [encode_webm](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-scripts/blob/master/script-opts/encode_webm.conf) keybinding in mpv

### Android Apps

### CLI tools I use all the time

Mine:

- FileHosting: To host files publicly quickly, I just sync it up to my server and serve it with `nginx`, using my [`remsync`](https://github.com/purarue/vps/blob/master/bin/remsync) script. [`croc`](https://github.com/schollz/croc) is nice, but that assumes the other person has terminal literacy
- [password generator](https://github.com/purarue/genpasswd)
- [url shortener](https://github.com/purarue/no-db-shorturl/) with [this script](https://github.com/purarue/vps/blob/master/bin/shorten) to create new public URLs

Also use [`draglastpic`](https://purarue.xyz/d/draglastpic) very often, which lets me drag the latest screenshot to some application
