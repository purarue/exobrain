- to make a folder, can use a medium density wood, like poplar or birch - [instructions](https://youtu.be/492DKS3Z9XE?list=PL7JQte6_XNbi54cCA1SCbAemJVeLr3oi_&t=403) (could also use high density but would be harder to cut with hand tools)

- use 70-90 gsm for paper
- for linen thread, use a 18/3
- cotton can also be used, or embroidery floss
- can wax thread with candle or beeswax (easier threading and prevents knots)
