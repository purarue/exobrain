title: Sewing

for embrodiery:

- cotton fabric scraps
- cotton thread
- cotton, relatively thick (depending on the size I want)
  - I don't want it to be super twisted, like most embroidery threads
  - I can also just use other thread and double it up, and then spin to create my own thicker thread
- heat erasable pen for drawing patterns

- when sewing, shouldn't be longer than I can reach comfortably (from my heart to as far as I can reach with my sewing hand), otherwise might get twisted/not enjoyable
- to combine threads (when I run out), can go through 4-5 holes, stitching through my last 5 stitches, and then leave a couple centimeters of thread loose (it shouldn't move, as long as your thread is thick enough/you sewed through the other thread). Should always wet the fabric before cutting/tying those as threads shrink when wet, see [techniques for changing threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQoM1OJRJT4)
