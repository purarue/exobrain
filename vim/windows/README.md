Title: Vim Windows/Buffers Notes

### Creating/Switching Windows

`<C-w>S` to horizontal split
`<C-w>v` to vertical split
`<C-w>q` to close window
`<C-w>w` to switch windows
`<C-w>h/j/k/l` to switch windows

```
map <leader> <C-W>
```

... makes this much more ergonomic, since I can do `<SPC>w <movement>` to switch windows, or `<SPC>ww` to switch windows, `<SPC>wq` to quit.
