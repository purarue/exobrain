Title: Magic Wands
---

Use `magic wands`! They're awesome. Learnt about them from [`rwx.gg`](https://rwx.gg) (the `magic wands` is his term)

In command mode, you can hit `!!` twice, to bring up a prompt which will send the current line to some external command.

For example, if you write:

`which docker-compose`

and then on that line, type `!!bash`, it'll send that to bash, and replace the current line with the output of that command.

`/home/sean/.local/bin/docker-compose`

Could just as easily send some snippet of code to python or perl, or *anything*.

* `:.$ to run vim commands`
* `:.! to run external commands`

This doesn't have to be on single lines though, you can do `6!!` to send 6 lines to some external command.

As an example for vim commands, the keystrokes you'd have to do to write 5 lines to another file would be:

`5!!<delete>$:w /tmp/output`

the `delete` is to replace the `!` (external vim command) to a `$`, which specifies a vim command.

The line would look like:

`:.,.+4$:w /tmp/foo`

The complicated `.,.+4` is generated by vim when you do `!!5`, `$:w /tmp/foo` is the command I typed in.

I have a script called `ix` [here](https://sean.fish/d/ix?dark) which accepts some text as STDIN and makes an `ix` (pastebin), so I can do something like:

`5!!ix -v` (which becomes `:.,.+4!ix -v`)

.. which takes those 5 lines and uploads them to `ix`, copying a link to that paste to my clipboard, without ever leaving `vim`!
