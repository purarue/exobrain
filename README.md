As described by `beepb00p`:

Exobrain, or "second brain", or "brain dump" is something like public wiki where you can keep your notes, ideas and thoughts. Other people can search in your exobrain without having to physically interact with you.

I use mine to store notes from books, videos, list resources, along with anything else I don't want to forget. 

Some of the more complete notes are converted to blog posts eventually.

Head to the [sitemap](/sitemap) or [blog feed](/feed) for whats on here.

Other Notable Pages:

  - [Tools](/tools), or how I do everything.
  - [Projects](/projects), for a list of all of my programming projects.
  - [Internet Superhighway](/superhighway), other sites/blogs I recommend.
  - [Meta](/meta), for more information about this site.

TODO:

- Still to to implement the searching feature, planning on periodically caching the rendered MD files in a genserver on my elixir server to fuzzy match against the pages here :)
