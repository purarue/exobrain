Exobrain, "second brain", or "brain dump" is something like public wiki where you can keep your notes, ideas and thoughts.

I use mine to store notes from books, videos, list resources, along with anything else I don't want to forget. 

Head to the [sitemap](/sitemap) or [blog feed](/feed) for whats on here.

Other Notable Pages:

  - [Tools](/tools), or how I do everything.

  - [Meta](/meta), for more information about this site.
