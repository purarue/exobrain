Title: exobrain
---

As described by `beepb00p`:

Exobrain, or "second brain", or "brain dump" is something like public wiki where you can keep your notes, ideas and thoughts. Other people can search in your exobrain without having to physically interact with you.

I use mine to store notes from books, keynotes, videos, and anything else I don't want to forget. 

Some of the more complete notes are converted to blog posts eventually.

Head to the [sitemap](./sitemap) or [blog feed](./feed) for whats on here.

TODO:

- Still to to implement the searching feature, planning on periodically caching the rendered MD files in a genserver on my elixir server to fuzzy match against the pages here :)
