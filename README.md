Title: exobrain
---

## Head to the [sitemap](./sitemap) to see whats on here.

As described by `beepb00p`: Exobrain, or "second brain", or "brain dump" is something like public wiki where you can keep your notes, ideas and thoughts. Other people can search in your exobrain without having to physically interact with you.

I use mine to store notes from books, keynotes, videos, and anything else I don't want to forget.

Inspired by [beepb00p](https://beepb00p.xyz/exobrain/exobrain.html), Structure/build tooling modified from [here](https://gitlab.com/rwx.gg/README).
