After applying these changes, please re-login in order for them to take effect.

You don&#39;t appear to have a sane system configuration. It is very likely that you
encounter xruns. Please apply all the above mentioned changes and start jack again!

Your system has an audio group, but you are not a member of it.
Please add yourself to the audio group by executing (as root):
  usermod -a -G audio sean</code></pre><p>So, I ran: <code>sudo usermod -aG audio "$(whoami)"</code><p>Should be noted that the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit">arch wiki</a> says to instead manually add your user to the <code>realtime</code> group, but sonic-pi needs you to be running this manually, so, not going to do that.<p>After restarting:<pre><code>$ groups
docker users video audio wheel</code></pre><p>After that, running <code>sonic-pi</code> causes this error:<pre><code>connect(2) call to /dev/shm/jack-1000/default/jack_0 failed (err=No such file or directory)
could not open driver .so &#39;/usr/lib/jack/jack_net.so&#39;: libcelt0.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

could not open driver .so &#39;/usr/lib/jack/jack_firewire.so&#39;: libffado.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code></pre><p>I use <code>pulseaudio</code> instead of <code>alsa</code>. Seems that <code>JACK</code> works better with <code>alsa</code> (i.e. it has a backend for it, see <code>man jackd</code>).<p>Doesn’t seem that theres a jack daemon running in the background, not sure if there should be:<pre><code>[ ~ ] $ ps -ef | grep jack
sean        1959    1934  0 11:14 pts/9    00:00:00 grep jack</code></pre><p>I found the solution to this on <a href="https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/issues/1908">this</a> issue; which is to run <code>jackd</code> and <code>qjackctl</code> manually:<pre><code>$ cat &quot;$(which sonic-pi-run)&quot;

#!/bin/bash

jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:1 &amp;
qjackctl &amp;  # (yay -S qjackctl)
# wait for jackd and qjackctl to be up
sleep 5
sonic-pi # block

# kill background jobs
kill -15 $(jobs -p)</code></pre><p>If something is already using <code>hw:1</code> (e.g. you have <code>mpv</code> playing some audio), this causes <code>jackd</code> to not be able to use <code>hw:1</code>, so it fails to squire that, and <code>sonic-pi</code> fails with an error again.<p>Without <code>qjackctl</code>, it seems that this causes <code>pulseaudio</code> to break… ? and it becomes ‘dummy output’:<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bnRQ8aQ.png"><p>So, what I typically do is:<ul><li>make sure I’ve used <code>pulseaudio</code> at least once since the computer has started (just play some song in <code>mpv</code> and then quit)<li>quit everything that is using <code>pulseaudio</code> actively<li>run <code>sonic-pi-run</code> (the script above)</ul><p>And then, when I exit, <code>pulseaudio</code> takes back over.<p>Success!<p>Downsides:<ul><li>Have to be a bit careful about mistakenly opening multiple instances of <code>sonic-pi</code>. If I open it and then quit quickly, something may have been acquired but not released, which causes <code>pulseaudio</code> to become ‘dummy output’, or jack to fail to acquire <code>hw:1</code>.<li>‘breaks’ system audio/<code>pulseaudio</code> while sonic-pi is open, so its the only thing that can use audio</ul><p>References:<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/issues/849"class="uri">https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/issues/849</a><li><a href="https://www.miskatonic.org/2015/01/17/setting-up-sonic-pi-on-ubuntu/"class="uri">https://www.miskatonic.org/2015/01/17/setting-up-sonic-pi-on-ubuntu/</a><li><a href="https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/issues/1908"class="uri">https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi/issues/1908</a></ul></div></main><footer><p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode"id="copyright">© 2020 Sean Breckenridge.
