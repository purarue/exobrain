Title: How I watch Twitch

Running the heavy [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) Web UI lags my computer considerably, so I prefer not to use it.

For interacting with chat, I use [chatterino](https://chatterino.com/), which handles that part completely.

At the core of it, streaming twitch streams all depends on [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/), which handles grabbing the URLs to stream from. [`mpv`](https://mpv.io) has a good interop and can make calls out to `youtube-dl`. So the easiest way to do this, without any configuration, would be to install `mpv` and `youtube-dl`, and then run:

`mpv https://twitch.tv/<username>`

However, that gives you no control over the quality of the stream.

To get the format codes, you pass the `-F` flag to `youtube-dl`:

```
$ youtube-dl -F "https://twitch.tv/<username>"

```

The format code is the first column, so if you wanted to stream in `480p` to conserve bandwidth, you'd use `480p`, and pass that to `mpv` like:

```
mpv "https://twitch.tv/<username>" --ytdl-format="480p"
```

Thats the basics. I have a couple wrapper scripts I use, so if you're interested in those, keep reading.

I do this so often - picking a format code and using mpv to stream something, that I wrote [`mpvf`](https://gitlab.com/seanbreckenridge/mpvf/), which takes a link, calls `youtube-dl -F` on it, prompting you to select one, then streaming that with `mpv`.

![example using fzf to prompt](images/demo.gif)

I further wrapped `mpvf` into a script called `twitch`, which:

* accepts the name of a twitch streamer as the first argument
* opens chatterino if its not already open
* prompts me to select a format and starts streaming in the background.

```
#!/bin/sh
# open chatterino and use mpv to stream from twitch
STREAMER="${1:?'Pass the twitch user to stream from as the first argument.'}"
export MPVF_PICKER=rofi
pgrep -x chatterino >/dev/null || chatterino &
setsid mpvf "https://www.twitch.tv/${STREAMER}" &
```

The `setsid` is to run `mpv` in a new session, to make sure that I don't have to leave the terminal which I ran `twitch <username>` from open, that can be closed once `mpv` starts running. Run `man setsid` for more info.

All of this streaming from command line is sort of useless if I still have to open the Twitch website to see if someone is online, so I wrote [twitchlive](https://gitlab.com/seanbreckenridge/twitchlive/) to be able to see which streamers I'm following are online. Its a bit annoying to set up due to how the twitch API is aimed towards web and not CLI applications, but it works well:
